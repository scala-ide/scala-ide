/** A generic message to inform that an actor should terminate. */

/** Base class used by all actors in the debugger module.
  *
  * This base class for actors provides a number of interesting functionalities:
  *
  * - Automatic logging of all messages processed by the actor. This can be quite useful when debugging.
  * - Stackable behaviors. By calling `become/unbecome` an actor can easily modify the shape of
  * messages that it can process.
  * - Cleaner actor's life-cylce. Basically, when starting an actor, `postStart` hook is guaranteed
  * to be called before the processing of any message. Then, the actor will process messages accordingly
  * to its `behavior` implementation. If an `Exit` or `PoisonPill` message is processed by `this` actor,
  * the actor is guaranteed to execute `preExit` before terminating.
