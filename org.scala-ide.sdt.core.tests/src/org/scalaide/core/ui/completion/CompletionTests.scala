 *
 * It can also handle Eclipse linked mode model. To depict such a model in the test
 * simply surround the identifiers that should be considered by the linked model
 * with [[ and ]]. The cursor is always represented by a ^.

   *        `foo(Int)(Int): Int` for a function that returns an `Int` and has
   *        two parameter lists that both take an `Int` or `foo(): Int - a.b.Type`
   *        for a function that has a zero arg parameter list, returns `Int` and
   *        is located in `a.b.Type`.
   * @param enableOverwrite
   *        If `true` the completion overwrite feature is enabled
   * @param expectedCompletions
   *        All the completions that are _at least_ expected to be found. If `Nil`
   *        this option can be seen as not considered by the test.
   * @param expectedNumberOfCompletions
   *        The number of completions that are expected to be found. A negative
   *        value means that this option is not considered by the test.
