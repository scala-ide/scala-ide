/** Use the `EclipseLogger` when you want to communicate with the user. Messages logged
 *  through the `EclipseLogger` are persisted in the Error Log.
 *
 *  This class is meant to be thread-safe, but it isn't because of a possible race condition existing
 *  in the Eclipse Logger. Indeed, the call to `ScalaPlugin.plugin.getLog()` isn't thread-safe, but
 *  there is really nothing we can do about it. The issue is that the `logs` map accessed in
 *  [[org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.InternalPlatform.getLog(bundle)]] is not synchronized.
 *
 *  Mantainers should evolve this class by keeping in mind that the `EclipseLogger` will be
 *  accessed by different threads at the same time, so it is important to keep this class lock-free,
 *  and thread-safe (or maybe a better wording would be: as much thread-safe as it can be).
 *  And that is actually the main motivation for using an [[java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference]]
 *  for `lastCrash`. Also, note that declaring `lastCrash` as volatile (instead of using a
 *  [[java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference]]) would have made this class less correct (because
 *  volatile fields don't offer atomic operations such as `getAndSet`).
