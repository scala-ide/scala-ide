/**
 * Used to carry information about scope of sources compilation in given project.
 *
 * Compilation scope is a set of sources which are compiled together and
 * a product of compilation is usually stored in scope specific output folder.<br/>
 *
 * There are defined (as a convention) 3 scopes (can be changed in future so following
 * can be treated as example in scopes defining):
 *  - macros with default source path: <project root>/src/macros* and
 *    especially for Play projects <project root>/conf*
 *  - tests with default source path: <project root>/src/test* and (because of
 *    Play projects) <project root>/test*
 *  - main which gets all source paths which don't match macros and tests scopes
 *    (* is a wildcard so for example to tests scope are assigned sources from
 *    folders src/test, src/test-my-special)
 *
 * The scopes are compiled in order: macros, main, tests. The compilation is
 * conditional so if any scope compilation fails then further scopes are not
 * compiled. So when macros compilation fails then neither main nor tests is
 * compiles. When macros compiles successfully and main fails then tests scope is not compiled.
 *
 * When given eclipse project (let name it B) depends on other project (let
 * call it A) then there are introduced additional dependencies between
 * projects' scopes:
 *  - macros of B depends on macros and main of A. So macros of B requires the
 *    correct compilations of macros and main scopes in project A
 *  - main of B depends on macros and main of A
 *  - tests of B depends on macros, main and tests of A
 *
 * Refer to [[SbtScopesBuildManager]] implementation for
 * implementation details.
 *
 * The feature is controlled by 'useScopesCompiler' exposed on 'build manager' tab in
 * Scala->Compiler preferences menu. If this flag is not set then compilation process
 * falls to old approach implemented in [[ProjectsDependentSbtBuildManager]].
