 * @parem name
 *        A short descriptive name for the save action. It is displayed to
 *        users.
 * @param description
 *        A (detailed) description about what the save action is doing. It is
 *        displayed to users and the only way to describe the behavior of the
 *        save action in detail.
 * @param codeExample
 *        A short code example that depicts on which part of the sources the
 *        save action is working on. The IDE can execute save actions
 *        (especially the corresponding save action) on this code in order to
 *        show users how they change the code.
