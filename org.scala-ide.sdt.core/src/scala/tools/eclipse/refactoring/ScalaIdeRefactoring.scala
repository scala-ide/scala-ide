/**
 * This is the abstract base class for all the concrete refactoring instances.
 * 
 * It serves as a bridge between the LTK and a refactoring in the library; it 
 * connects the LTK's refactoring with the library's refactorings by creating 
 * the change objects for Eclipse (these are not the same as the `Change` 
 * objects in the library) and checks the initial and final conditions of a 
 * refactoring, i.e., it displays the errors that can be returned by the library's 
 * `prepare` and `perform` methods.
 * 
 * A refactoring always proceeds in the following way:  
 *  
 *  - The refactoring is prepared, using the selection.
 *  - Any errors that occurred during preparation are reported
 *    with the `checkInitialConditions` method.
 *  - The refactoring is performed, taking user input into account 
 *    (provided by the subclass).
 *  - If any errors occurred, these are reported through the
 *    `checkFinalConditions` method.
 *  - A change object is generated via the `createChange` method.
 *
 * @param getName The displayable name of this refactoring.
 * @param file The file this refactoring started from.
